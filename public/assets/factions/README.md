# Faction Background Images

Place faction background images here as `<slug>.webp`.

The slug for each faction is produced by `factionSlug(faction.name)` —
lowercase with non-alphanumeric runs replaced by `_`, with the overrides
in `src/lib/factionSlug.ts` applied first (e.g. UCA → `uca`).

Registered images (place the file, it is picked up automatically):
